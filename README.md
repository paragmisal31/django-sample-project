django-sample-project
=====================

This is an implementation of the official Django tutorial with a couple of test cases and an extra third-party app: [django-sample-app](https://github.com/danirus/django-sample-app). Both are part of the example of Continuous Integration of webapps with Buildbot: [buildbot-sample-conf](https://github.com/danirus/buildbot-sample-conf).

    python manage.py syncdb --noinput
    coverage run manage.py test --settings mysite.test_settings  # to test polls app and produce coverage data
    coverage html -include=polls/* --omit=polls/tests/*          # visit html output at htmlcov/index.html
    python manage.py runserver # (user: admin, password: admin)
